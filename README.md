# Bias from a causality perspective
The code provided here is a companion to the article 
'A study on group fairness in healthcare outcomes for nursing home residents during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Basque Country' by Inouzhe, Barrio,
Rodríguez-Álvarez, Gordaliza, Bengoechea and Quintana. All the tools to use the methods presenetd there and to apply them to a dataset are supplied.
## Structure
We make available software both in R and Python. 
-  In 'Unfair_treatment_in_nursing_homes.Rmd' we provide an R tutorial on how to use the procedures introduced in Inouzhe et al on a synthetic dataset.
We hope taht this will allow any interested practironer to apply it to their own data.
-  In 'Sensitivity_Analysis-toy_example.ipynb' we provide a Python tutorial, largely based on https://github.com/vveitch/causality-tutorials, on how to
use the methods introduced in https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01747 for sensitivity analysis.
